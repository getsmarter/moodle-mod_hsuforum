This files describes API changes in /mod/hsuforum/*,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 3.0 ===
 * External function get_forums_by_courses now returns and additional field "cancreatediscussions" that indicates if the user
   can create discussions in the forum.
 * A new optional parameter (groupid) has been added to get_forum_discussions.
   This parameter can override the automatically calculated current group.
 * New constant HSUFORUM_POSTS_ALL_USER_GROUPS, to be used as parameter in functions where we'd need to retrieve all the user posts.

=== 2.7 ===
* All forum tracking options removed and tracking forced
* Manual marking of posts as read is now removed
* Old posts are automatically marked as read

=== 2.6 ===

* The file post_form.php should not be included, the class it contained has
  been moved so that it can benefit from autoloading.
* The function hsuforum_shorten_post() has been deprecated. It was doing a poor
  job of shortening forum post text and the shorten_text() function does a
  much better job.
* The constant HSUFORUM_TRACKING_ON has been depreciated and replaced by
  HSUFORUM_TRACKING_FORCED. The value between them is maintained, so they are
  interchangeable, but code should migrate to the new name.

=== 2.5 ===

The function hsuforum_check_throttling has been changed so that a warning object is returned when a user has reached the 'Post threshold for warning' or
'Post threshold for blocking' setting, rather than echoing this on screen. This allows the warning to be moved inside the post form as it can be added
as a HTML element, where it is more noticeable. False is returned if there is no need to warn, or restrict the user from posting - see MDL-39182.

=== 2.3.5, 2.4.2 ===

* mod/hsuforum:allowforcesubscribe capability will be forcefully assigned to frontpage role, as it was mistakenly missed off
when the capability was initially created. If you don't want users with frontpage role to get forum (with forcesubscribe) emails,
then please remove this capability for frontpage role.
